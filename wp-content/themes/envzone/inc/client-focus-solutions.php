                    <p>
                        On the other hand, the element of uncertainty can associate with the process. This is where we come in to handle major issues such as data security, pricing, quality and business ethics that could make outsourcing go wrong.

                            Here, the client assembles and maintains its team, comprising of highly skilled and specialized personnel. This is a preferred effective arrangement when as a client, you have found the perfect team and want to take advantage of their skills by deploying them for long-term or multiple projects.

                        <p>
                            And our partner, on the other hand, is responsible for the basics such as keeping track of leaves, schedules and paying the personnel under him or her. They will also create the teams and conduct product development.

                            Our client might choose to get help in the daily management tasks, by hiring a project manager. EnvZone also provides flexibility in addition to the pool of clients we provide. Since unavailable members can be replaced immediately, we can minimize the project's disruption. The client receives updates and reports on the progress of the project and can offer suggestions when needed.

                            This type of arrangement involves the least involvement by the client.

                        <p>
                            Here, you give our partners a goal, a completion deadline and expect them to provide outcomes. You do not have to oversee the project completely, all you will get is result-oriented outcomes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The disadvantages of this arrangement are risks of reduced transparency and other ethics issues. As the client, you will also need to ensure that goals do not change as your project progresses. This can change the outcome of the project, making it expensive and time-consuming to correct.
