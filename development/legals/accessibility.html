                            This site has been designed for ease of use. The main navigation includes all the main sections of the website and runs across the top of each page. Clicking on any of these items will take you to a specific section of the website, where the navigation is displayed down the left. Choosing a section on the left hand navigation will also reveal any further content pages within a section up above. This style of navigation is consistent throughout the site.
